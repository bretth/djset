Djset
=====

Djset simplifies managing secrets in your django settings.

A common django configuration pattern is to use environment variables in production environments with a local unversioned settings file to hold your secret development api keys and other settings. Djset simplifies management of secret settings locally by using the shell environ, system keyring, and optionally user prompted settings. In a production environment secrets not found in the environ will raise a ImproperlyConfigured error.

Djset is a convenience layer on top of the python keyring library.


Installation
---------------

Djset currently requires python >= 2.6. There are currently some outstanding issues with python keyring on python 3.


``pip install djset``

To install the optional environment variable helpers (in OSX or Linux) put ``source dexportunset.sh`` in your post_activate script if you use virtualenvwrapper or in your shell startup file if you don't.

Djset is entirely dependent on the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable being set in the environment. I recommend setting it in the post_activate script like ``export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=yourproject.settings``.

Usage
--------

In your settings.py add the following against any setting you don't want to be kept in plain text:

	from djset import DjSet
	
	s = DjSet()
	KEY = s.get('KEY')

The key is resolved in the following order:

	environment
	    |
	keychain in the KEY.NAME.keyring namespace (local)
	    |
	keychain in the KEY.keyring namespace (global)
            |
        prompt for input or raise ImproperlyConfigured

By default the *NAME* in the namespace is your DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE. To use an alternate namespace: 

	s = DjSet(name='yourname')
        
To set a default value if the key is absent from all locations:
``SECRET_KEY = s.get('SECRET_KEY', 'xyzâ€™)``

Lets say you introduce a new setting into a shared repository but want to let developers set their own values. To prompt for the value instead of raising an error:

``s.prompt = True``

To add and remove keys use the command line:

        djset add <key>=<value> [--global] [--name]
        djset remove <key> [--global] [--name]

For example ``djset add SECRET_KEY=xyz``

Note::

    OSX and Gnome don't have an api for removing keys so on those platforms the value is cleared.


All commands trigger a django runserver reload by changing the modified time on the settings file.

An alternative/complement to storing it secretly is to export it to the current environment. The following commands (OSX & Linux only) behave the same as shell export and unset but also trigger the reload. ie:

	dexport <key>=<value>
	dunset <key>
